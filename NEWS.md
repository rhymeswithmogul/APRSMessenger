# News for APRSMessenger

## Version 1.0.2 (March 21, 2023)
In this version, we've fixed bugs related to group bulletins not being received correctly, message acknowledgements not working, and printing packets to the output stream.

We've also included Pester testing to ensure that this app works as intended.

Finally, this version contains a catalog file to verify its authenticity, and to help it run when execution policies require signed code. 

## Version 1.0.1 (March 20, 2023)
Fixed a very embarrassing bug where APRS messages wouldn't be sent to the APRS-IS network.  Oops.

## Version 1.0.0 (March 19, 2023)
Initial release.
