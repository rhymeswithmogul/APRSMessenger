This was just a generic icon I whipped up using the PowerShell logo and a map, in the style of [APRS.fi](https://aprs.fi).  Feel free to make a better one.

## Formats
 -  The `.xcf` file is the source image, created in GIMP.
 -  The PNG file is the one linked in the module manifest and used in PowerShell Gallery.  It must be 85 pixels square.
 -  All others formats are here for convenience, in hopes they'll be useful.

## License
This image is covered under the module's same license.

## Easter Egg
The map location is of scenic [Kent Falls State Park](https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/State-Parks/Parks/Kent-Falls-State-Park).  I'm sure someone out there would eventually try reverse-engineering it.  I'll spare you the trouble.  (It's also a great hike.)
